			   <h2>Who We Are</h2>
				<p>Bus Éireann is a bus and coach operator providing services throughout Ireland with the exception of Dublin Region bus services which are provided by sister company Dublin Bus.
				It is a subsidiary of Córas Iompair Éireann. The company's primary hub is Busáras – Central Bus Station, located in Store Street, Central Dublin. Bus Éireann was established in
				February 1987 when it was split out from the Córas Iompair Éireann.</p>

                 <h3>The History of our home</h3>
                   <p>Bus Eireann has it's head office in Broadstone, Dublin 7. Broadstone has a very rich and interesting history. 
                      It has been a major cog in Ireland's transport wheel since the early nineteenth century. Going on to play a
                      significant role in the war for independence.</p>
                    <br/>
                   <h3>Harbour, King Inn and building of railway:</h3>
                   <p>Broadstone harbour’s location on the Royal Canal was chosen for its proximity to the markets and the law courts. 
                      Colton Street was the preferred site, but high land prices and objections from local residents forced its relocation 
                      to Broadstone. The Kings Inns, designed by James Gandon, was built opposite the harbour and, like the Four Courts and 
                      Custom House, was designed with its frontage on a waterfront. By 1807 a regular passage boat service was operating to
                      Mullingar. In 1845 the Midland and Great Western Railway Company (MGWR) purchased the Royal Canal Company as they wanted 
                      to run their new railway to Mullingar on the land alongside the canal. The canal passed in front of the station and the
                      station subsequently became part of the canal dock with a goods yard and a cattle bank. In the 19th century Broadstone 
                      was one of the most well known areas of Dublin and was home to one of the major transport hubs in Dublin, containing a 
                      major railway station and a canal harbour. 
                   </p><br/>
                   <h3>Broadstone building:</h3>
                   <p>Dublin is a city of fine station building and Broadstone is one of them. Sited on a hill, its most dramatic feature was
                      its railway shed with its huge colonnade of columns. The station was designed by architect John Skipton Mulvany and
                      Broadstone was considered his masterpiece. Constructed of granite in an austere neo-egyptian style work began in 1842 
                      and completed in 1850 and a pontoon bridge across the canal gave access to the station. Just eleven years after the
                      station was built extensive alterations were made to the terminus, including the erection of the beautiful colonnade
                      about fifty feet in width by 600 feet in length. The interior of the station was being further beautified by the painting 
                      in bright colours of the roof, pillars and delicate iron work of the spacious and graceful shed – the building, altogether, 
                      presenting a railway terminus in every way worthy of a great and enterprising company.The original railway shed roof 
                      designed by Richard Turner proved to be too ambitious for the span and was replaced after it collapsed in the early 1850s.
                      It was the hub of the Midland Great Western Railway, it was not only the Dublin terminus but also the Company’s HQ and
                      largest locomotive depot.
                   </p><br/>
                   <h3>Murder:</h3>
                   <p>James Spollen, a handyman at the Broadstone Terminus of the Midland Great Western Railway, was charged in November 1856
                      with the murder of Mr. George Samuel Little.  The murder was carried out upstairs in Room 8A following a robbery of an
                      amount of up to £200 pounds. Mr. Spollen was acquitted following a trial the following August 1857.
                   </p><br/>
                   <h3>Closed canal and concentrate on railway business:</h3>
                   <p>The goods yard was disused after the opening of North Wall in 1864 and traffic for the city Cattle Market was dealt with 
                      until cattle facilities were opened at Liffey Junction in 1879. The MGWR soon lost interest in the canal business and in
                      1877 they received powers to close 150 yards of the branch and to fill in the harbour, which they did to construct a new
                      forecourt for the station. That removed the need for the pontoon, and a new approach road, Western Way was built by way of 
                      the aqueduct.  A new quay and stores were to be built on the other side of the aqueduct but that never happened and, with 
                      Spencer Dock operational since 1873, boats gradually stopped using the branch. In the last decade of the 19th century saw 
                      the introduction to the Midland of electric light and in 1897 they began the installation of electric light bulbs in their
                      carriages. In 1906 the Midland made application to the Board of Trade for permission to close the Broadstone section of 
                      the Royal Canal as it had been lying in disuse for some time. Permission was refused but section was eventually closed in
                      the late 1920s.
                   </p><br/>
                   <h3>1914 outbreak of the Great War:</h3>
                   <p>During the First World War from 1914 to 1918 quite a number of the staff of the Midland joined the British Army and fought
                      for the freedom of small nations.  Of those who fought, 49 were killed in action and are commemorated by this plaque in the 
                      main Hall. There are also plaques in Heuston and Connolly Station and they would have been erected after 1918 by the railway
                      companies with the local branch of the British Legion. Richmond Barracks in Templemore became a large training depot for Irish 
                      recruits joining the British army, particularly the Royal Munster Fusiliers, the Leinster Regiment and the Royal Dublin Fusiliers.
                      Thousands of Irishmen were trained in Templemore.

                   <h3>1916 – Monday/Tuesday:</h3>
                   <p>Over the Easter period in 1916 there were 4,000 soldier all on leave. Piaras Béaslaí, a senior member of the volunteers, recounted 
                      that as early as February 1915, he and Edward (Ned) Daly had come to Broadstone station to meet an IRB member called Gerald Griffin, 
                      who worked for Midland. Griffin showed the men around the station and brought them to Liffey Junction were he explained about all the 
                      loop lines, connections, points and signal boxed and how they could all be put out of action. One of the aims of the lst Battalion
                      in Easter Week was to occupy Broadstone.However, the volunteers only held the station for a short period on Easter Monday and it
                      was retaken by the British on Tuesday, 25 April. On the Monday night ‘B’ Company, under Captain James Sullivan, erected barricades 
                      on the northern flank at the North Circular Road and the Cabra Road while engineer Captain Frank Daly proceeded to destroy some of 
                      he railway infrastructure in the area. They blew up the permanent way, seized a steam engine and placed it on the up-line to block
                      all incoming trains. They also destroyed the signal system and cut telegraph lines. In the early hours of the morning on Tuesday,
                      25 April the permanent way at Blanchardstown was blown up and a cattle special proceeding in advance of the troop train was derailed 
                      and wrecked.  On the same morning a steam engine at Broadstone was seized by the rebels, placed on the up line and started with those
                      in charge jumping clear as soon as the engine began to gather speed. After running uncontrolled for about a mile it was thrown off 
                      at the Liffey Junction points. Meanwhile the troops had been diverted to another station were they detained without mishap.
                   </p><br/>
                   <h3>Tuesday – Fusiliers barricade:</h3>
                   <p>On Tuesday, 25 April a small, under the command of Captain Dinny O’Callaghan of ‘A’ Company, 1st Battalion, were ordered by
                      Commandant Ned Daly to occupy Broadstone Railway Station but by now a unit of Dublin Fusiliers had taken it over. The Royal
                      Dublin Fusiliers had forced their way into the centre of the city by Cabra Road and fought the Volunteers along the railway
                      line from Broadstone Railway Station. The Volunteers were fired on, and driven back south towards North Brunswick Street and
                      Linenhall. Colonel Meldon of the 4th Royal Dublin Fusiliers established his HQ at the Broadstone Railway Station. As a result 
                      of a strong military cordon drawn around the whole district of Phibsborough and  Drumcondra all traffic was held up between
                      the northern suburbs and the heart of Dublin. One British soldier was killed on 28 April, 2nd Lt George Gray, a dental student
                      aged 22.
                    </p><br/>
                    <h3>Clock tower:</h3>
                    <p>On Friday, 28 April a sad tragedy took place when a young Dominic O’Donoghue and a companion went to the top of the clock tower
                      across from Broadstone to see the fires in the city, both were killed by military snips position at Broadstone.
                    </p><br/>
                    <h3>To 1920 – Galway man shot:</h3>
                    <p>Joseph Howley, a member of the Irish Volunteers from Galway, was shot dead by the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) at Broadstone 
                      Railway Station on 4 December 1920.  A special intelligence unit attached to the RIC known as the Cairo Gang was responsible.
                    </p><br/>
                    <h3>Closure of line and amalgamation of rail companies:</h3>
                    <p>The Railways Act, passed on 23 August 1924, amalgamated the Midland Great Western Railway, the Dublin and South Eastern Railway
                      and 23 other railways companies to form the Great Southern Railway heralded the end of Broadstone as a Railway Station. The last
                      locomotive built at Broadstone was in 1927 and from then railway repair work was gradually phased out and concentrated at Inchicore 
                      and road vehicle maintenance was developed at Broadstone. During the following decade the GSR began setting up a road passenger 
                      service and bought over many of the independent operators. In 1931 the western end of Broadstone was taken over by the Road Passenger 
                      Section. Broadstone was closed as a passenger train station in January 1937 and trains to Galway and Sligo transferred to Westland Row.
                      Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ) was established in 1945, inheriting a rich history and tradition from its predecessors in rail, road and water
                      transport disciplines. The wagon repair shops and the loco depot were closed in 1961 and since then the whole area has been given over to
                      road passenger vehicles. Bus Éireann was formed in 1987 as a subsidiary of CIÉ to provide bus services throughout Ireland with the exception
                      of Dublin City.
